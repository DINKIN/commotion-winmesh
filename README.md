##Setup

###olsrd.conf
- olsrd.conf belongs in \Windows
- Paths to plugins must be specified relative to olsrd.exe
- You can also specify the olsrd.conf you want in the invocation. Give an invalid invocation and olsrd.exe will provide help.

###workout.py
Goal: workout.py is roughly tending toward [olsrd/files/olsrd-adhoc-setup](https://github.com/opentechinstitute/olsrd/blob/release-0.6.5.4/files/olsrd-adhoc-setup)
